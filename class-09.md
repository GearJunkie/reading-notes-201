# Forms

- receive user data and compute it.

- the data from a form is a "string" datatype.

- forms contain a default that erases your data (use event.preventDefault();


# Browser Events

- basically user interaction within the browser is an event (click, dblclick, submit, scroll, etc...).

- javascript has a listener that you can activate which will react or compute something if a specific event occurs.

- forms can have html validation, which can let the user know something about the data they input or neglect to input correctly.
