# Summary:

- CSS treats html elements as if they had their own box
- CSS controls the dimensions, borders, margins, and padding
- It's possible to hide elements using display and visibility properties
- block-level can be made into inline and the other way around as well
- CSS3 introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded corners
