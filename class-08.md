# CSS:

- screens size: can change from user to user. fixed width layouts do not scale for the user. liquid layouts will scale to the user's screen or resize if they change the size of the window within their screen.

- layouts: websites are usually designed in a grid pattern, which makes structuring and styling easier to change.

- frameworks: provide prewritten code for many tasks.

- multiple style sheets: can be used to work on different styling, such as one for fonts and colors, and another for the layout.
