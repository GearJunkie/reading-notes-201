# Debugging Code

- Chrome has a debugging tool that allows you to pause at certain points within your code and run that portion of code to test for errors.

- Console in the browser is good to inform you of which line your error is in and what the error might be.

- Placing good functioning console.logs will ensure that your code is running properly as you go along.
